| [TabLit.py](https://github.com/Prajwalsrinvas/Tablit/blob/main/TabLit.py) | The code provided is a Streamlit application that allows users to chat with tabular data using a language model. The application provides a user interface where the user can upload or crawl web data, explore the data, and then engage in a conversation with the language model.The core functionalities of the code include:-Setting up the Streamlit interface with a sidebar for user inputs and displaying the chat interface.-Handling user input and displaying previous chat messages.-Integrating with the language model to generate responses to user queries.-Pre-processing and formatting data for ingestion by the language model.-Allowing users to explore the uploaded or crawled data in a tabular format.-Generating and displaying intermediate steps of the language model while processing user queries.-Saving the chat history and providing a link to the LangSmith trace.-Allowing users to provide feedback on the language model's responses.Overall, the code provides a streamlined interface for users to interact with the language model, allowing them to chat, explore data, and provide feedback to improve the model's performance. |
| [utils.py](https://github.com/Prajwalsrinvas/Tablit/blob/main/utils.py)   | This code provides several core functionalities:1. It creates a zip file containing selected files from a specified directory and allows users to download it.2. It generates a unique session ID using UUID.3. It deletes empty subfolders within a specified folder.4. It loads data from uploaded files in different formats (e.g., csv, excel) using pandas.5. It obtains credentials for a Nimble service based on secrets provided in the Streamlit app.6. It reads a configuration file in JSON format.7. It searches for data on a specified platform (e.g., ecommerce, SERP) using a search keyword.8. It saves search results in a CSV file and returns a DataFrame object.9. It saves the chat conversation in a JSON file.Overall, the code supports file manipulation, data processing, external API communication, and persistence of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
